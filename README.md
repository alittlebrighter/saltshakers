## Saltshakers
This is an application to aid in the creation of unique cell groups within a community on a monthly basis.  This is a great way to help members of the community get to know each other.  

### Back end
The back end is written in Go and uses the actor model.  This is my first attempt at using this paradigm so it may not make a lot of sense but I found some value in doing things this way.

## Front end
The front end/UI is built with Vue.js and Redux.  Redux is most likely overkill for this size of application but I'm hooked on the architecture for front end development.  The code for the front end can be found in `ui/spa`.  PRs are most welcome if you can improve the UI as my strengths lie more on the back end.
